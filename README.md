My first ever React app. I completed a React course on Scrimba and this was my first solo project.
The code is for a Quiz app developed in react. It has multiple choice questions based on my favourite NFT community Jelly.

You arrive at the home page. When you press start 5 random questions are selected. You can select your answers and press submit.

If you selected correctly you selection will turn green. If you are incorrect your selection will turn red and the correct option will turn green. If you manage to get 5/5 correct we celebrate with confetti!

You can try again with 5 different questions (big chance some will return as I only put 10 in the questionlist array). I've added a button to share the page on twitter.

This is my first ever full project. I am very proud of managing to complete it and it has helped me gain a lot of confidence with React. Please share any advice or corrections with me so that I can fix it or utilise it in further prjects.
